# ETH-system-identification

Midterm and final projects realized in the System Identification course at ETH ZÃ¼rich, given by Prof. Roy Smith.

Midterm Project:
- Problem 1: Estimation, validation, and smoothing of the transfer function of a linear time-invariant, discrete-time system
- Problem 2: Design of an input signal to be used in an identification experiment to give an estimate of an unkown plant

Final Project:
- Problem 1: Estimation of the parameters of an open-loop identification problem
- Problem 2: Estimation of the transfer function of a linear time-invariant, discrete-time system using Maximum Likelihood and Maximum A Posteriori methods
- Problem 3: Design of a series of experiments to identify the plant of a closed-loop system operating with a controller
